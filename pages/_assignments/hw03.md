> ## Collaboration and Code Sharing Policy: Read Carefully
> For this homework, you are welcome to work in pairs (optional). Even if you collaborate with someone else, you must still submit your own HTML and CSS files on Moodle. If you collaborate, you'll just list your partner in the comments section of Moodle. 
> 
> For those of you who are collaborating, please do not (a) "free ride" on your teammates or (b) enable free riders. Everyone in your group should understand every line of code they submit. 

## 1. Introduction
In this assignment, you will build a "data-driven" version of the interface you built in HW2 using JavaScript. Specifically, you will:

1. Build a very simple HTML "skeleton," and then write some "client-side" JavaScript to:
    * Query data from a server (using a REST API) and
    * Build DOM elements based on the data returned from the server.
    {:.compact} 
1. Ensure that your interface is accessible.

For this assignment, everything should be done by writing your own "vanilla" JavaScript. 

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> ### Working Demo
> If you want to see a working demo of the completed HW4 interface (ignore the login screen), take a look: 
> 
> <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/</a> 
> * username: **webdev**
> * password: **password** 
> {:.compact}
>
> The app may be asleep (because I'm using the cheap version of Heroku), so you may need to wait about 10 seconds for it to load.


## 2. Set Up

<a href="/fall2024/course-files/homework/photo-app.zip" class="nu-button">HW03 Starter Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a>

1. Download the starter files and save them inside of your `homework` folder.
1. Replace the the `index-replace.html` and `styles-replace.css` files in `photo-app` with the `index.html` and `styles.css` files you made in HW2.
1. Add the following script tag to the `index.html` file that you made from HW2 to link it to the starter JavaScript file<br>
`<script src="js/main.js" type="module" defer></script>`
1. Open your `photo-app` folder in VS Code.

Your folder structure should look like this:
```shell
photo-app
├── index.html  # your HW2 file
├── js
│   ├── main.js
│   └── utilities.js
└── styles.css  # your HW 2 file
```


## 3. Your Tasks
Please complete the tasks listed below. You're more than welcome to add more CSS & JS files as needed (though this is not necessary). 

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> ### Authentication Notes
> 
> * All fetch requests will need to pass a `Bearer Token` (for now) to authenticate with the REST API. We will go over this in class.
> * There is a helper function in `js/utilities.js` called `getAccessToken()` that will help you retrieve the access token. You will store this token in a variable and include it as an HTTP header in all of your server requests.
> * We will go over this in class.

{:#init}
### 1. Page Initialization Tasks (20 Points)
The functionality in this section must be invoked when the page first loads (so that the user sees each of these panels right away).

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Figure</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pt</td>
            <td>Right Panel: User Profile
            </td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel at the top, render an HTML representation of the current user's profile using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/profile</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4pts</td>
            <td>Right Panel: Suggested Accounts</td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel (underneath the user profile), render an HTML representation of suggested user accounts using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/suggestions</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4pts</td>
            <td>Stories Panel</td>
            <td>
                Render an HTML representation of stories from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/stories</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10pts</td>
            <td>Posts Panel</td>
            <td>
                Underneath the stories panel, renter an HTML representation of the first 10 posts from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts</code> endpoint. Please ensure that the following rules are honored:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If there is more than one comment associated with the post, display a “view all n comments” button (replace n by the actual number of comments) and only show the most recent comment. Otherwise, display a single comment below the title of the post (if one exists).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already liked the post, the heart icon should be red <i style="color: #cf0c0c" class="fas fa-heart"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-heart"></i>. You can check if the current user has liked the post by checking the post's<code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_like_id</code> data field. If the post has been liked by the current user, then this data field exists. Otherwise, the field is undefined. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already bookmarked the post, the bookmark icon should be black <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>. You can check if the current user has bookmarked the post by checking the post's<code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_bookmark_id</code> data field. If the post has been bookmarked by the current user, then this data field exists. Otherwise, then the field is undefined. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note that the content from each box should be generated from the API data (no hard-coding).

### 2. Create / Delete Data with Event Handlers (20 Points)
After implementing the read-only functionality, you will implement functionality that actually updates the data in your system as follows:

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>

            <th>Figure</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>3pts</td>

                    <li>
                        When the user clicks the heart of "unliked" post, a POST request is issued to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts/likes/</code> endpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the POST response indicates success, requery for the relevant post (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts/&lt;id&gt;</code>) and redraw it to show the updated data (which should indicate that the post has been liked).</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the number of likes is updated.</li>
                </ul>

{:#accessibility}
### 3. Accessibility Features (6 points)
Accessibility can be tricky when you're relying on the fetch API, because a screen reader doesn't always know that content has changed on the page. In addition, you don't want to be over-reliant on the mouse. Please take a look at the [Accessibility Resources](/fall2024/accessibility-reference/), and specifically the resources pertaining to aria roles and attributes.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>

                    <li>Hint: if you use the HTML <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> element for all of your buttons, you get this functionality for free.

                    <li>Like / Unlike button (1pts)</li>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

{:#github-commit}
### 4. Commit Everything to GitHub (2 points)
Please create a link from your homepage to your completed homework 2 webpage (see <a href="https://vanwars.github.io/csci344" target="_blank">Sarah's homepage</a> for an example). Then, commit and push all of your edits to GitHub and, paste a link to your GitHub Repository and to your GitHub pages in the Moodle submission.

* If you collaborated with someone, please list your partner's name in the comments section.


## 4. What to Turn In

### Rubric
Please review the requirements above and ensure you have met them. Specifically:

{:.medium}
| Points | Category |
|--|--|
| [20 points](#init) | Page initialization |
| [20 points](#post-detail) | Create / delete data features |
| [6 points](#accessibility) | Accessibility features |
| [2 points](#github-commit) | Successfully Deployed to GitHub + GitHub Pages and linked to your homepage |
| 2 points  | Composition and CSS (the UI looks like the screenshots provided). Everything still has to look good and be responsive. |
